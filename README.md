# FEConquest
Let me explain how the creation of this project is related to YOU and your happiness and financial success.

This project is a website that displays a bunch of info from the game "Fire Emblem Conquest".

If you look at the online wikis for the game, they have just about all the info a player needs to see character stats, skills, weapons, etc...

BUT...

the info on these wikis is a bit disorganized (requiring scrolling long pages or opening multiple tabs)... 
and in some cases, players have to literally do math to find out things like character growth rates and max stats.

Instead of scrolling/opening multiple tabs, what if there could be a **website that displays all characters in ONE PLACE and (almost) ALL a character's info on one screen?**

That's where my website comes in.



My FEConquest websites displays the base stats/weapons/level for every single playable character in the game (except for the child characters-- for now) on slick-looking character cards.

When the FEConquest website user clicks a character card, the website displays a much bigger window with detailed information on ALL of the character's classes.

**These bigger, more detailed windows have (almost) All the in-game combat info a player would want for that character, including:**
- âœ… Every character class, including heart-seal classes
- âœ… The available weapons and max weapons ranks for each character class
- âœ… Every skill for each class (including what level it is acquired, the skill name, the description and even the visual icon), plus the character's personal skill
- âœ… Each class's growth rates and maximum stats (you'd have to do the math yourself if you want this info from the wikis)
- âœ… As a bonus, the window also displays the fullsize character art and even the animated pixel art for each classðŸ¤º

The only thing the detailed windows are missing are the character supports. But who cares about those, anyway?



**Anyway. Working on this project required various skills that are applicable to many other business/art/whatever projects and websites. This includes:**
- ðŸŽ¯ Multi-layered careful HTML nesting (so that info can easily be "plugged in" without breaking the whole site)
- ðŸŽ¯ Precise but flexible CSS flexbox and grid positioning (so that things are spaced well on screen no matter the screen size)
- ðŸŽ¯ Complicated, precise 250 line+ Python scripts to get a bunch of info from the wikis (one wrong line and all of the info would get disorganized)
- ðŸŽ¯ Creating a big MongoDB database of character/class info by perfectly putting all the scraped wiki info into a JSON file and importing it
- ðŸŽ¯ Carefully connecting the backend database to the frontend HTML/Javascript (ended up being almost 500 lines of code)
- ðŸŽ¯ Once everything was in order, I used my "artist's eye" to write some kickass CSS and make the website look cool as heck

In total, the project ended up being around **1,600 lines of code**, most of it coming from the backend web-scrapping Python files and frontend Javascript.

And... the project **took me about exactly 14 days (two weeks)**.

(And that was while being distracted by other obligations, working out for 2 hours multiple times a week, and learning how to do most of the skills listed above from scratch.)



So if this project is giving you an "itch" to take advantage of my talents to boost YOUR business/personal/artistic/whatever success...

(and remember that once you have an awesome, visually appealing and rock-solidly functioning website, you get to keep it... for life!)
